											<h3> <b>About the Carbon Governance Living Lab</b></h3>
										</dl>
										<p>
											The Carbon Governance Living Lab (CGLL) is a Volt-Age-funded project based at Concordia University. It investigates local decarbonization initiatives designed to address climate change in municipalities, with the goal of supporting innovation and learning from best practices. 

<br> The CGLL is organized around three action committees that bring together academics and practitioners with expertise in climate governance and policy, electrification, just transitions, urban energy systems, and urban transformation. This dataset was developed as part of the work of Action Committee 1, whose mandate was to map the landscape of existing local decarbonization interventions, both planned and underway, in municipalities across Canada. For more information on the CGLL, visit our <a href="This stacked bar chart shows the proportional (%) use of each policy lever across the provinces and territories studied.

                                        <h3><b>About the dataset</b></h3>
                                        <dl>
This dataset comprises data extracted from 104 Canadian municipal climate action plans (CAPs), representing 104 communities across 10 provinces and 2 territories. The municipalities in this dataset are shown in the map of Canada below. These plans are usually organized around major emissions-producing activity sectors, such as transportation, waste, energy, and buildings. Given that buildings account for approximately 40% of global energy consumption and contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, they are a critical area of municipal climate action (Zhang et al., 2023; Jadidi et al., 2026). This dataset, therefore, includes only actions that municipalities included in the buildings section of their climate action plans. 
<br> We reviewed all 104 plans and identified 1283 building-related climate actions. Then, using the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance Framework for Long-Term Deep Carbon Reduction Planning, we grouped each action into one of 11 strategies and subsequently into one of four policy levers. For more on how this database was created, visit our methodology section.
